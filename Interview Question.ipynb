    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) What is Cucumber? What are the advantages of Cucumber?\n",
    "    To run functional tests written in a plain text Cucumber tool is used. It is written in a Ruby \n",
    "    programming language.\n",
    "    Advantages of Cucumber are:\n",
    "    • You can involve business stakeholders who cannot code\n",
    "    • End-user experience is a priority\n",

    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "## 2) What are the two files required to execute a Cucumber test scenario?\n",

    "    • Features\n",
    "    • Step Definition\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "## 3) explain the use of Background keyword in Cucumber?\n",
    "    Background keyword is used to group multiple given statements into a single group. The keyword \n",
    "    mostly used when the same set of given statements are repeated in each scenario of the feature \n",
    "    file.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "## 4) Give an example of a behavior is driven test in plain text?\n",
    "    • Feature: Visit XYZ page in abc.com\n",
    "    • Scenario: Visit abc.com\n",

    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "## 5) What is Scenario Outline in feature file?\n",
    "    Scenario Outline is the same scenario can be executed for multiple sets of data using the scenario \n",
    "    outline. The data is provided by a tabular structure separated by (I I).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6) Explain the term step definition in Cucumber\n",
    "    A step definition is the actual code implementation of the feature mentioned in the feature file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7) Give an example for step definition using “Given” function?\n",
    "    For example to make visitor visit the site “Yahoo” the command we use for given\n",
    "    Given (/^ I am on www.yahoo.com/) do\n",
    "    Browser.goto “http://www.yahoo.com.”\n",
    "    end – This will visit www.yahoo.com\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "## 8) What are the differences between Jbehave and Cucumber?\n",
    "    Although Cucumber and Jbehave are meant for the same purpose, acceptance tests are \n",
    "    completely different frameworks\n",
    "    • Jbehave is, and Cucumber is Ruby-based\n",
    "    • Jbehave are based on stories while Cucumber is based on features\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "## 9) Explain test harness\n",
    "    A test harness for Cucumber and rspec allows for separating responsibility between setting up the \n",
    "    context and interacting with the browser and cleaning up the step definition files\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "## 10) When to use Rspec and when to use Cucumber?\n",
    "    • Rspec is used for Unit Testing\n",
    "    • Cucumber is used for Behavior-driven development. Cucumber can be used for System and \n",
    "    Integration Tests\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "## 11) What is the language used for expressing scenario in feature file?\n",
    "    Gherkin language is used to express scenario in feature files and ruby files containing unobtrusive \n",
    "    automation testing for the steps in scenarios\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "## 12) What are regular expressions?\n",
    "    A regular expression is a pattern describing a certain amount of text. The most basic regular \n",
    "    expression consists of a single literal character.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "## 13) What is BDD?\n",
    "    BDD or Behavior-driven development is a process of developing software based on TDD (Test \n",
    "    Driven Development) which focusses on the behavioral specification of software testing units.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 14) What software do you need to run a Cucumber Web Test cases?\n",
    "    • Ruby and its Development Kit\n",
    "    • Cucumber\n",
    "    • IDE like ActiveState\n",
    "    • Watir ( To simulate browser)\n",
    "    • Ansicon and rspec (if required)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "## 15) What does a cucumber features/ support file contain?\n",
    "    Features/ support file contains supporting ruby code. Files in support load before those in \n",

    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "## 16) What is a Feature file?\n",
    "    Features file contain a high-level description of the Test Scenario in simple language. It is known \n",
    "    as Gherkin which is a plain English text language. Feature File consists of the following \n",
    "    components like:\n",
    "    • Feature: It describes the current test script which has to be executed.\n",
    "    • Scenario: It is steps and expected outcome for a specific test case.\n",
    "    • Scenario outline: Scenario can be executed for multiple sets of data using scenario outline.\n",
    "    • Given: It specifies the context of the text to be executed.\n",
    "    • When: specifies the test action which has to perform.\n",
    "    • Then: Expected outcome of the test can be represented by “Then”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 17) What is Selenium?\n",
    "    Selenium is an automation tool which is a widely used tool for Functional Testing of the web￾based application. Selenium supports different language like ruby, java, python C#, etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 18) Why use Cucumber with Selenium?\n",
    "    Cucumber and Selenium are two popular technologies. Many organizations use Selenium for \n",
    "    functional testing. These organizations which are using Selenium want to integrate Cucumber \n",

    "    • Cucumber Testing enhances the end-user experience\n",
    "    • Style of writing tests allow for easier reuse of code in the tests\n",
    "    • Allows quick and easy setup and execution\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 20) What is a Step Definition?\n",
    "    Step definition maps the Test Case Steps in the feature files to code. It executes the steps on \n",
    "    Application Under Test and checks the outcomes against expected results. In order to execute \n",
    "    step definition it must match the given component in a feature.\n",
